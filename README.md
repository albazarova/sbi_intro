### Working with ray cluster

An example of how to submit jobs on the development partition of Juwels booster (JSC) with ray backend for distributed training is available withing the folder `ray_cluster`. You will need a judoor account for this.

If it is the first time you are using this repo on the cluster, use `source ray_env/setup.sh` to create the required python environment.

Afterwards, use `source ray_env/activate.sh` to activate the corresponding environment. Then use the batch script `run_ray_on_slurm.sbatch` in order to submit an example script `ray_joblib.py`
